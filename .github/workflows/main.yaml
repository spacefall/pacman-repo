# Controls when the workflow will run
on: [push, workflow_dispatch]
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  #push:
  #  branches: [ "main" ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  #workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
